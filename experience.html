					<h3>2015-2016 | Sever's Corn Maze and Fall Festival</h3>
					<h4>Farm Hand/Laborer/Festival Worker</h4>
					<p>
						Between the ages of 12 and 14, I got the opportunity to
						earn money officially at a real job. In the Spring and
						Summer months I helped hoe the fields from weeds and
						harvest pumpkins, while in the Fall I assisted at the
						Fall Festival. There I primarily worked at the parking
						lot, cleaned the walking areas, and removed weeds from
						the Maze. Although this job has little to do with my
						current work interests, I personally think having a job
						at that young of an age molded me to value work and
						money as well as improving my ability to communicate
						with others in a professional manner.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="job2">
					<h3>2019 | Oakman Construction</h3>
					<h4>Construction Assistant</h4>
					<p>
						Similar to my time with Sever's, I worked primarily
						physically, helping dig holes for cement, mixing that
						cement, helping build or refurbish decks, and other jobs
						that pertain to the field of residential contracting. I
						see this time as being quite valuable for shaping my
						ability to work long hours and improve my communication
						skills.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="job3">
					<h3>2019-2021 | Fleet Farm</h3>
					<h4>Sales Floor Representative</h4>
					<p>
						At Fleet Farm much of my experience from previous jobs
						carried over, primarily the ability to lift heavy items
						and to professionally communicate with others. A lot of
						my work consisted of assessing the scope of work for the
						day, communicating what I planned on doing to help
						accomplish our goals for our department, department
						mastery and memorization, and constant priority
						evaluation. Satisfying the needs of our patrons was also
						necessary, many time working with them to solve their
						problem rather than simply locating the item for which
						they initially came for. Priority evaluation was also
						critical because at any given time there were multiple
						genuinely important jobs that could be done, and the
						focus needed to be given to the most critical jobs
						first. Similarly to the previously listed jobs, my
						communications skills vastly improved, as well as
						problem solving, interpersonal communication, customer
						service, and time management.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="job4">
					<h3>2022-Present | Uber, Roadie, DoorDash</h3>
					<h4>Freelance Delivery Driver</h4>
					<p>
						Currently I work as a freelance delivery driver,
						primarily to maintain income while being able to help my
						family with remodeling, moving, as well as volunteering
						at my church. This job is intentionally temporary, and
						is being held to increase my flexibility prior to
						getting a permanent position.
