					<h1>Whisper AI Frontend (WAF)</h1>
				</section>

				<section id="WAF-0">
					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>
						This project was launched to streamline and improve my
						own workflow when it came to automatically captioning
						files meant for use with a television station. This
						process of captioning can be done manually, but it is
						very time-consuming and presents a large issue for
						volunteers who need to fill in this role. All of this
						lead me to combine both the staging, captioning, and
						output of the files that are included in this workflow.
					</p>
					<p>
						While this application is meant for a very specific
						purpose, I still worked to retain much of the
						flexibility of the original CLI interface in the GUI.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="WAF-1">
					<h2>Architecture</h2>
					<p>
						This program is written in Python, utilizing the
						custom-tkinter library for the Graphical User Interface.
						Whisper is a large language model developed by openai,
						and is free to use non-commercially. The program
						integrates this model throught the use of a python
						package.
					</p>
					<p>
						The program utilizes a config file which it references
						at start-up to load in variables that were stored from
						the last run. If the config file does not exist, then it
						is created and default variables are stored. After every
						major function of the program, the variables that are
						currently in use are stored.
					</p>
					<p>
						A custom progress bar was created that integrates the
						whisper progress API in a method that processes it into
						the GUI.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section id="WAF-2">
					<h2>GUI</h2>
					<p>
						As mentioned, the custom-tkinter package was chosen to
						create the GUI. Initially, a GUI mockup was created in
						Draw.io to have a solid concept image for the desired
						interface design. Most of the elements present in the
						mockup were integrated in the final application, with
						the exception of the "Reset Status" functionality
						(Although this may be implemented in the future).
					</p>

				</section>
				<section id="WAF-3">
					<h2>Workflow</h2>
					<p>
						Upon opening the application, any variables saved from
						the previous session are initialized into the program.
						The user chooses the input directory, which should
						include the audio file they wish to transcribe. If the
						"Choose File Automatically" flag is checked, then the
						program will automatically select the file with the
						latest modification date within the input folder. If
						not, the user may select their input file manually. The
						user also has the option to select an output directory
						manually, or have one created for them automatically
						within the input folder.
					</p>
					<p>
						Once these variables are ready, the user may start
						transcribing the audio file by selecting "Transcribe".
						Once the whisper model gets started, the user will
						notice that the transcription progress bar will start
						progressing in roughly 5%-10% increments. Once the
						transcription completes, the user may also choose to
						view the output files.
					</p>
					<p>
						Additional Features: The user may select their desired
						UI scaling, which will resize the program window when
						they do. UI scaling is a saved variable that loads upon
						subsequent program startups, and resizes the windows
						upon startup accordingly.

					<h1>BERT-Based Code Completer (BBCC)</h1>
				</section>

				<section id="BBCC0">
					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>
						This was a project initally started during my time at
						WSU as a final project for a Machine Learning class. The
						initial project was a simple python script with very
						rudimentary user control. Numerous improvements have
						been made to increase performance, accuracy, and
						usability. However, the limitations of BERT need to be
						noted, and the ultimate use for this agent is for
						inspiration, rather than raw performance
