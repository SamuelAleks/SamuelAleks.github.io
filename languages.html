						<h4><b>6/10</b> - Fairly Confident</h4>
						<p>
							I was first introduced to C++ in College. Although I
							have heard of it before, I mentally relegated its

							have realized the benefits and possibilities of C++
							both in increasing program efficiency and a gain of

						</h3>
						<h4><b>6/10</b> - Fairly Confident</h4>
						<p>
							Some may argue that Bash itself is not a programming
							language, however it still takes skill to create
							scripts for bash. Over the years I have interacted
							with, and created scripts for the Bash Shell.
							Although nowadays, I use ZSH on my personal desktop,
							the scripting language is still the same.

						</h3>
						<h4><b>10/10</b> - Very Confident</h4>
						<p>
							HTML has been a staple of web development even since
							it's release, and the same could be said for my use
							of HTML as well. As it is well, known, HTML is the
							primary markup language of the web, and is what I
							used to create this website. I have designed
							numerous pages over the years utilizing HTML, and
							and quite confident in most of its features.

						<h3>
							<img

								alt="CSS Logo"

						</h3>
						<h4><b>10/10</b> - Very Confident</h4>
						<p>
							Similarly to HTML, CSS is not a full scripting
							language, however, you just as much cannot escape
							its ubiquitous use within the web. For most of my
							time using CSS, I have used plain CSS, however,
							recently I have been taking advantage of some CSS
							frameworks to speed up my workflow. Namely,
							bootstrap, although I still prefer the
							customizability that raw CSS provides.

						</h3>
						<h4><b>7/10</b> - Confident</h4>
						<p>
							Javascript is quite a powerful language that allows
							one to extends their website. I have used and am
							currently using JavaScript in order to provide
							features and design improvements that would
							otherwise being impossible with plain HTML and CSS

						<h4><b>5/10</b> - Fairly Confident</h4>

							Being quite a prolific language in the server-side

						<h4><b>3/10</b> - Getting Started</h4>
						<p>
							Assembly, although quite difficult, is a language

						<h4><b>2/10</b> - Hello World</h4>
						<p>
							As part of an in-class research project, I had the
							honor to cover the FORTRAN Language. From that
							research I grew a fondeness for it's capabilities
							and it's relatively modern additions. Going in to it
							I expected an old language that was hard to
							understand, but I realized that it is a much more
							readable language than a lot that I have experience

						<h4><b>4/10</b> - Getting Started</h4>
						<p>
							I hava a limited but existing knowledge of C#. I
							have not really had a reason over the years to
							utlize C# for my projects, but I have created a few
							simple projects with it and am still rather
							confident in it due to its similarity to other

						<h4><b>5/10</b> - Fairly Confident</h4>
						<p>
							After some projects in C++, I learned that Rust was
							a very similar language but with the added benefit
							of memory safety. This intrigued me, causing me to
							apply Rust to a few simple programs.
